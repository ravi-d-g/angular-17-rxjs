<h2> Subscription works!</h2>
<p>What is a Subscription? A Subscription is an object that represents a disposable
    resource, usually the execution of
    an Observable. A Subscription has one important method, unsubscribe, that takes no argument and just disposes the
    resource held by the subscription. In previous versions of RxJS, Subscription was called "Disposable".</p>
