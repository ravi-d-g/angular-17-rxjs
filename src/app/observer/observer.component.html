<h2>Observer works!</h2>


<p>What is an Observer? An Observer is a consumer of values delivered by an Observable. Observers are simply a set of
    callbacks, one for each type of notification delivered by the Observable: next, error, and complete. The following
    is an example of a typical Observer object:


</p>
<code ngNonBindable>
    {{
    const observer = {
        next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
        error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
        complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),
      } 
      }}
